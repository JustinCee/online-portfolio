          putting in the grunt work. I am an introvert but once I am comfortable
          around you I open up easily. I can be a very loud person but I know
          when to use my inside voice.</q

          >My passion for the tech industry came from when i was in high school
          and they offered a class called Computer Applications Technology
          (CAT). That was the first time i was introduced to very Basic HTML.
          From there i was taught how to create a very basic website. We had to
          do Practical assignments and in each one of those assignments we had
          to create a website that basically outlines everything you did in your
          assignment. When i finished high school I applied for a technical
          support learnership and it was successful. I have been in the tech
          industry ever since.</q
